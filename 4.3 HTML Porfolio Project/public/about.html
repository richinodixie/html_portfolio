  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi there! My name is Richard, and I want to develop a CBT website for people suffering from anxiety!</p>

  <p>I graduated with a degree in business administration and psychology from Washington University in St. Louis in the
    winter of 2022. Currently I'm working in the mental health field, and will return to school (University of Chicago)
    to
    pursue a Master of Social Work!</p>

  <p>I took four classes in Computer Science (incl. Web Dev) in undergrad, but didn't like them. But I find online
    self-help websites immensely helpful (ha) after using one myself. Mojo was able to help me with my psychogenic
    erectile dysfunction issues, so I wanted to build a website like it to help more people!</p>
